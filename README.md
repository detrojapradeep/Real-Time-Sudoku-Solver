## Overview
Sudoku is one of the most popular puzzle of all time.The goal of Sudoku is to fill 9x9 grid such that each row,each column and 3x3 grid contains all of the digits between 1 to 9. In this project we aim to create a real time Sudoku solver which recognise the elements of Sudoku puzzle and providing a digital solution using Computer vision. Sudoku Solver is the collection of very basic image processing techniques. A very good way to start is the OpenCV library which can be compiled on almost all the platforms.
